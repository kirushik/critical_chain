# Address PR Review Comments

Fetch unresolved review comments from the current PR and address them one by one.

## Step 1: Fetch PR Data

Run the following to get the current PR number:
```bash
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'
```

Then get the repo owner/name and fetch all unresolved review threads using GraphQL (replace `$PR_NUMBER`, `$OWNER`, and `$REPO` with the results):
```bash
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + "/" + .name'
```

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "$OWNER", name: "$REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: $PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          id
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              body
              path
              line
              originalLine
              author { login }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | {id: .id, file: .comments.nodes[0].path, line: .comments.nodes[0].line, author: .comments.nodes[0].author.login, body: .comments.nodes[0].body, replies: ((.comments.nodes | length) - 1)}'
```

## Step 2: Process Each Comment

For each unresolved review comment, process it as follows:

### 2a. Investigate
- Read the referenced file and line to understand the current code and surrounding context.
- Investigate the codebase to verify whether the reviewer's claim is accurate.
  - For claims about what exists/doesn't exist in the codebase, search for the actual code.
  - For claims about correctness, verify against actual implementations.
  - For claims about library behavior, check official documentation (via Context7 or online) or run small tests if needed; don't trust reviewers to always have accurate knowledge.
  - For style/convention suggestions, check existing patterns in the codebase.

### 2b. Decide & Act
Classify the comment into one of three categories:

**Fix it** — the reviewer is correct, and the fix is straightforward:
- Apply the fix directly.
- Briefly state what was changed and why the reviewer was right.

**Skip it** — the reviewer is wrong, nitpicking, or the suggestion doesn't improve things:
- Explain concisely *why* the comment is being skipped (e.g., "the reviewer's suggested path also doesn't exist; the current code is correct because...").
- Do not change anything.

**Ask the user** — the comment raises a valid point but the right fix is unclear, or it's a judgment call:
- Present the comment, your investigation findings, and the options.
- Wait for the user's decision before proceeding.

## Step 3: Summary

After processing all comments, provide a summary:
- How many comments were addressed (fixed)
- How many were skipped (with brief reasons)
- How many needed user input
- Any follow-up actions needed

## Important Guidelines

- **Never reply to or resolve comments on GitHub.** Only make local code changes.
- **Always verify reviewer claims** before acting on them. Automated reviewers (like Copilot) often hallucinate file paths, counts, or behavior.
- **Group related comments** — if multiple comments say the same thing about different lines, investigate once and fix all occurrences together.
- When the comment includes a `suggestion` block, evaluate the suggestion on its merits; don't blindly apply it.
- Run relevant quality checks after making changes (linters, tests) to ensure nothing breaks.
